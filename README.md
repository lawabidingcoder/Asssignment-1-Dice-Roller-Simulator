For my first week of the Developer Academy Bootcamp, I was tasked with two projects, building on the basic Python skills we have been learning all week. assignment_one is a rolling dice project, which involves writing a program that simulates rolling a dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6, and the program prints that number. I used my foundational knowledge in these Python topics: Random module Integer Print function While Loops assignment_two is a program that randomly generates a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program returns an indication to how wrong the user is, similarly if the user guesses correctly, a positive indication appears. I used my foundational knowledge in these Python topics: Random module Variables Integers Input/Output Print While loops If/Else statements
